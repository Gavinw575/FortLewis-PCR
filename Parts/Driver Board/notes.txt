Diferences between Pololu #1451 board and OpenPCR board

Polou board uses VHN5019 chip, OpenPCR uses VNH3SP30
Truth tables are the same
VESD is at 2KV for VHN5019 and 4-5KV for VNH3SP30

Capacitance across 12V and GND is diferent open pcr uses 3300uf, polou chip uses 47uf and 0.1uf in paralel equivelent to 47.1uf.

Polou bord has a 10k resistor to ground between pwm board and 1k resistor to pwm chip

ENA/DIAGA chip and ENB/DIAGB chip on Open PCR is conected to 5v over 3.3k resistors, Pololu uses a voltage divider that multiplies voltage by 4.7/5.7 from ENA board and ENB board

on Polou board CS and CS_DIS are used for curent sensing
on Polou board CP and VBAT used with transistor for reverse battery protection

Polou board has LEDs for showing output curent direction

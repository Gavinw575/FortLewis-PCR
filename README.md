FLC-PCR is a field deployable and low cost PCR thermocycler developed by students at Fort Lewis College. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) is the process of duplicating a strand of DNA millions of times. After the DNA has been amplified analysis can be performed to detect pathogens and other DNA related characteristics. Performing PCR on a strand of DNA involves placing the sample in a chemical solution. Then repeating the raising and lowering the temperature duplicates the DNA. Raising the temperature splits the strands and lowering the temperature allows the chemicals to reform the other half of each DNA strand.

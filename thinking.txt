The Objective:
	use block thermoreceptor to get an accurate estimate of the temperature inside the tubes

What I Know:
	the System worked with some byproducts, so temperatures must be close, +- 5 to 10 deg
	things that changed since PCR experiment:
		tubes where not inserted with thermal paste
		moved from breadboard to pcb
		software lid on/off added
		Thermocouples added to tubes, measured ones are open
		Every hole was filled with a tube instead of 6 mid and 4 corner
		Less weight was put on top of the lid
		lid was no longer flush with each tube
		used diferent tubes
	Temperature calibration observations:
		temperature at peak is 30 ish degrees off, worst case.
		The old calabration shows much less diference and used thermal paste between the tube and block but no water
	Thermocouples are acurate at measureing temperature
	block used has many inconsistancies

Things I've ben told:
	30 ish degrees is too far off, PCR shouldn’t happen
	increasing the contact between the block and tubes won’t help:
		Aluminum + plastic + water can't be cycled that quickly
	
What I think:
	PCR did happen but 30 degrees is too far off
		the only change made to the thermal properties between experiment and calabration was removing the thermal paste
			The 30 ish degree difference must be due to removing the thermal paste
				We need better contact between the tubes and the block

If what I think is worng:
	increasing the contact between the block and tubes won’t help
		The 30 ish degree difference is accurate and occured during PCR experiment
			PCR did happen
				PCR can happen 30 ish dregrees off from target

Questions I need to ask:
	What temperatures where we most likely at based on PCR results?
	How dose contact between the block and the tubes affect Thermal performance?
	If The 30 ish degree difference not a contact problem than what is it and how can it be fixed?
	If both options are wrong, what then?

# Debug

This is a python PyQt application that was developed in tandam with `PCRControl` for testing and debugging in early development. It is no longer supported and has been completely replaced with `FLC-PCR UI` in `UI APP`. If for some reason you really need to use it, run the command `verbose\n` after starting.
